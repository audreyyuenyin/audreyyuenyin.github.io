	<h1> Audrey Tong </h1>
	<p> Hello there! I am a University of Waterloo student major in Mathematics and Chartered Professional Accountancy.
	After high school I started out in accounting, which is indeed what I enjoy so I never look back.
	Meanwhile, I realized how technologies are changing our daily lives, and it is now the fourth industrial revolution where technology shines. I would like to join this wave, and am determined to fusion accounting and technology. 
	/* End */
	<p> A final thought: Note that I did not use the word 'passion' anywhere in this page. I watched a TED talk a couple years ago (and sorry for not remembering whose talk that was), but her speech sticked in my mind. She said, 'Success fuels passion more than passion fuels success.' I agree, so I am constantly learning and trying earn the word - to say it proudly someday - Passion. </p>
	<p> Thanks for visiting! </p>
